## [R/lmmlite](http://kbroman.org/lmmlite) - R port of [pylmm](https://github.com/nickFurlotte/pylmm)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kbroman/lmmlite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kbroman/lmmlite)

Karl Broman (following the code in
[Nick Furlotte](http://whatmind.com)'s [pylmm](https://github.com/nickFurlotte/pylmm))

In order to better understand [pylmm](https://github.com/nickFurlotte/pylmm),
for linear mixed models for genome-wide association studies
(GWAS), I wrote an R version of the algorithm.
